Oases project

Project Introduction:

Development and Demonstration of a Sustainable Open Access AU-EU Ecosystem for Energy System Modelling (OASES)
The overall project objective is the development and demonstration of an open and sustainable AU–EU ecosystem including a well-proven energy system modelling chain. ​
The ecosystem will enable European and African scientists and energy system planners to perform and optimize national scenario analysis on their own. ​
The idea of open source should pave the way to a long-term collaboration between AU and EU countries leading to further joint works in energy system modelling.​
Coordinator: Fraunhofer IEE (Germany) ​

Partner:  CSIR, University of Venda (both South Africa), Helwan University (Egypt), CDER (Algeria), VTT (Finland), University of Kassel (Germany)​
Energy system modelling is the basis for the development and integration of renewable energy at local, national, regional, continental and global levels. ​

The resulting energy scenarios are crucial for understanding the contexts in which technologies and energy solutions must be developed and contribute to optimising future energy systems.​
In the field of energy system modelling, there is a lack of holistic approaches that combine all steps from the generation of RE input data, potential analysis, RE distribution, time series generation to system models.​
The required input data are the interfaces to the energy system model with regard to the spatial distribution of renewable energies, taking into account existing plants, potential areas and the resource assessment as well as the time series generation based on this.​
